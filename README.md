DISCLAIMER: I am a complete noob!  I'm using this project as a learning tool.  Several aspects will also be overkill for a project of this size and complexity.
**********

OVERVIEW:
Rearchitecture of Stefan Lehmann's implementation of iot devices on ESP8266 boards:

    (https://github.com/stlehmann/esp8266_iot_nodes.git)

I what to seperate board configuration and application configuration to set up an environment where core functionality
(wifi and mqtt) is initialized for all new devices.  From there, easily download/implement application-specific code
for sensors, relays, devices, and functionality.

I will update readme as I progress to my architecture.

# ESP8266 IOT Nodes

A collection of IoT clients based on the famous ESP8266 microcontroller 
(aka [NodeMCU][0]) using the [Micropython][1] programming language. All clients
use the [MQTT protocol][2] for data exchange. MQTT is a light-weight 
machine2machine protocol supporting publish/subscribe messaging transport.

## Hardware Installation

Each node has a recommended hardware setup which you can find in its README 
file. However it is completely up to you to change the layout, extend more 
sensors or install additional features.

## Software Installation

1. Install Micropython on your ESP8266 NodeMCU prototyping board. There is a 
very comprehensive guide available on [micropython.org][3] that uses the software
[esptool][5] to erase the flash and install the latest Micropython firmware. Please follow the
[instruction set][3].
2. Connect to your Node using a REPL. [mpfshell][4] is a good choice here. You
can also use the [WebREPL][6] if you like, but make sure your node is connected to
Wifi and WebREPL is activated.
3. Transfer the necessary files for the node of your choice on your device


## Nodes

| Node name        | description                              | 
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [BME280][7]      | humidity, temperature, pressure sensor   |
| [FS1000A][8]     | radio controlled power switch            |
| [DS18X20][9]     | digital temperature sensor               |
| [HC-SR501][10]   | passive infrared motion sensor           |
| [moisture][11]   | soil moisture sensor                     |
